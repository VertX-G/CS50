            “Toast was a pointless invention from the Dark Ages. Toast was an implement of torture that caused all those subjected to it to regurgitate in verbal form the sins and crimes of their past lives.
            Toast was a ritual item devoured by fetishists in the belief that it would enhance their kinetic and sexual powers. Toast cannot be explained by any rational means.
            Toast is me.
            I am toast.”

            Of syllabubs and jellies and mincepies,
            And other such ladylike luxuries.”
