get a height (i) from the user
if (i) is larger than 0 and smaller or equal to 8, continue, else return to line1

make a loop that iterates (i) number of times
    for the first run, make (i-1) amount of spaces, (i*1) number of # and a new line
    for the second run, make (i-2) amount of spaces, (i*2) number of # and a new line
    and so on...
