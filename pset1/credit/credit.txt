    Modulating by 10 returns the last digit of the sequence
    dividing by 10 removes the last digit from a sequence - returns the sequence minus the last digit
    div10 until answer is < 1
    can add a counter to div10 to count the number of digits

    loop until 'div' < 1
        ones = number mod 10    (modulate number by 10 to get the last digit 'ones')
        testNumber = number / 10    (divide number by 10 to remove the last digit)
        counter ++              (add 1 to count to count the number of digits)

        //multiply every second digit by 2 and add its digits to 'everyOther' (multiply 'everyOther' by 10 then add digit) (everyOther = (everyOther * 10) + ones)

    starting from the second to last digit, multiply every other digit by 2
    add each digit of the results together
    add this result to the sum of other digit starting from the last digit of the card number
    if the result mod 10 = 0, the card is valid
    if checksum fails, return INVALID\n
    if the checksum passes, continue to check card type

Check AMEX
    number must contain 15 digits
    The first digit must be 3
    the second digit must be 4 or 7
    return AMEX\n

Check MASTERCARD
    number must contain 16 digits
    first digit must be 5
    second digit must be 1-5
    return MASTERCARD\n

Check VISA
    number must contain 13 or 16 digits
    number must start with 4
    return VISA\n
